## Project description
### LinkedIn Crawler 
We plan to develop a LinkedIn crawler, that uses the information found on an user's LinkedIn profile to generate a resume. There will be multiple templates from which the user can choose, with multiple color schemes and fonts, and the user will be able to choose what information to display from the one retrieved by the crawler.
