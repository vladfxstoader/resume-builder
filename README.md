## Project description
### LinkedIn Crawler - resume builder
The application helps users build their resumes based on their LinkedIn profile information. After the user puts their LinkedIn profile link, they are able to choose between 3 resume templates and they can also add a 'Projects' section to their resume in which they can put their most relevant projects. This can be an useful feature for students who do not have work experience.
